                  “Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but
                  while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it
                  is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains.” –

              Conditioning the water. Tap water comes with countless properties
              that need to be balanced in an aquarium to support aquatic life.
              To condition water properly, use a dechlorinating agent along with
              a biological aquarium supplement.

              Maintaining proper pH levels. pH is an indicator of the acidity or
              alkalinity of your tank water. Buy a pH test kit to check the pH
              level. Freshwater fish typically thrive when the pH level is
              between 6.8 and 7.5, depending on the species, as it is the range
              that will offer a natural environment that helps your fish resist
              illness.

              Decorating your aquarium helps your fish feel at home, and it’s
              fun too! Some fish like open spaces to swim, while others need
              cover to relax and put on their best colors. Do research to find
              out what type of habitat your fish like and decorate your aquarium
              accordingly. The first fish to inhabit the aquarium will claim the
              best spots, so add decorations gradually with each new fish
              purchase, to give the newcomers a place of their own.

              Your first fish may hide a lot. Don’t worry, that’s normal. Being
              caught in a net at the store, placed in a bag and ending up in a
              new place tends to be scary for most fish. Make sure there are
              enough decorations in the aquarium to make them feel safe. Another
              reason fish hide is that when they don’t see other fish swimming
              around, they think there’s a predator lurking about. Don’t panic,
              as you add more fish and decorations, they’ll come out!

            <section class="tipList">
              Your fish need to rest! Put your aquarium light on a regular
              on/off cycle to give your fish some down-time and prevent
              unsightly algae growth. If your light doesn’t have a built-in
              timer (many do nowadays), a standard light timer from the hardware
              store will do just fine! Planted aquariums need 10 to 12 hours of
              light, while non-planted tanks do best with 6 to 7 hours.
